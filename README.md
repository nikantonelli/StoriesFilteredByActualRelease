StoriesFilteredByActualRelease
==============================

## Overview

One page that has all the bits you need to filter just stories by a number of parameters

Filter Options:

Per Release or Iterations (through the app settings page)

By ScheduleState
By a user chosen field, e.g. a custom field that selects the Actual Release (code drop) a story got shipped in

Any combination of the above and also the ability to invert the sense of each filter, e.g. NOT in a particular 
release
